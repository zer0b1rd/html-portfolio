        <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
        <p>The story of Spirited Away is just amazing, the visuals are stunning and the whole anime is a masterpiece.</p>
        
        <br />

        <h3>Ex Machina</h3>
        <p>
            Is a super interesting and beautiful movie about an experiment with a female human A.I. 
            <br /> 
            It raises moral questions about when a human being is a human being. It is my favorite movie that is not an anime.

        <h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
        <p>
            Princess Mononoke is an incredibly beautiful, but also deeply serious anime, which addresses important points of society/humanity. 
            <br />
            I've probably seen this movie over 15 times and it never gets bad or boring.
